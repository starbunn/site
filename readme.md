# site

this is my personal/portfolio website.

it's made using [nextjs], typescript, sass w/ postcss, and [prisma](https://prisma.io/).

## <big>information for people wishing to use this code</big>

dont. this code was made by me for myself and not for you. you are unable to use it without ***extensive*** modification. the [license](https://github.com/noirelapine/site/blob/main/license) of this code was specifically chosen in order to make reuse of this code *verbatim* very difficult.

if you still want to use this backend, please keep the following things in mind:

1. all blog content is rights reserved. i will pursue and report content theft.
2. you ***MUST*** fully comply with the license. ***i will report & agressively pursue people that are not in compliance with the license***.
3.  you are on your own. i will not help you make this code work for yourself. this is code i made for myself, and the only reason i am making it open source is for access to multiple tools free *only for public repositories* and easier deployment. don't be the person who makes me close source this.
4.  upon security issues being found or remediated, you will ***not*** be notified about issues or remediation instructions.

to be honest, this is probably *not* what you are looking for. make your own website. check out [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [zola](https://www.getzola.org/), [nextjs], or countless other options to make a website.

they're going to be maintained better than this website, at least.
